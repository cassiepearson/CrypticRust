# Number Theory Module

#### Overview 
Most of this module is implemented in the form of trait objects. This means that all of the trait objects can operate on all types compatible with the Integer trait. This trait is inclusive of all positive and negative integers. Not all functions in these modules are actually useful on integers that could be negative. However, the goal is for the traits to be compatible with the entire integer number line.

##### What is this module?
This module provides numerous common mathematical functions from number theory. Some will be used in various parts of the cryptography. Others are less useful, but I put them in anyways.
