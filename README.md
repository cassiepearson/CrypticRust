# Math Repository

Each module has its own README with details on what it does. This repository is a collection of various computational math that I have played around with.

## Rust

### Testing

To see the results of any functions, run the unit tests. You can use the following commands to do so:

```
cargo test                            // Run all tests in debug mode
cargo test --release                  // Run all tests in release (optimized) mode
```

### Documentation

Rust has an auto-documentation system built in. To see the documentation run:

```
cargo doc --document-private-items --open
```
