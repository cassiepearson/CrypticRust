# Math Repository

This is a spot for smaller computational math functions that I have written that did not belong in my other repositories.

## Rust Math

### Building

To build a binary run:

```
cargo build                           // Build a debug binary
cargo build --release                 // Build a realease (optimized) binary
```

### Testing

To see the results of any functions, run the unit tests. You can use the following commands to do so:

```
cargo test                            // Run all tests in debug mode
cargo test --release                  // Run all tests in release (optimized) mode
```

### Documentation

Rust has an autodocumentation system built in. To see the documentation run:

```
cargo doc --document-private-items --open
```
